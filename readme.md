# Getting Started with Indoor Potted Plants

> Or, _so you want to stop murdering all of your indoor potted plants_

## Potting

### Basics

- Pick pots with a hole in the bottom
  - This probably also means you will need a saucer for each pot
  - Make sure that when the pot is on the saucer, it can still drain
- Add a layer of rocks or broken pottery in the bottom of each pot
  - This helps with drainage
- Use potting soil, not soil from outside
  - Most places will have an organic version that is just as cheap as Miracle-Gro or w/e
  - Don't worry about the composition of the soil yet, except
    - Use succulent/cactus soil for succulents/cacti
    - _succulent/cacti_: plants that evolved in deserts and store water in the plant itself

### Further Questions

- Do I need to worry about fertilizer?
  - Not yet. Just forget about it for now and come back in like 9 months.
- There are some really cool pots that don't have holes? Can I use them?
  - No
    - But they're really cool!
      - I know but still no
    - But--
      - You can cut a hole in them with the right kind of drill
      - But for now, stick to things with holes in them
    - But I've seen your plants and you have some in pots without holes
      - This is true, but I only ever do that with plants I can spare (spiderlings mostly)
      - I assume anything I put in a pot with a hole is going to eventually get root rot
      - And then also I water it like 1/3 as much as anything else

## Plants

### Basics

- Think about where the plant is from originally
  - Succulents are desert plants that evolved to store water in their leaves to survive long droughts
    - ergo, they are great with flood/drought - you can just water the hell out of them once/two weeks and they will love it
    - also generally great with tons of light, sometimes okay with less
  - other hand, Basil is Mediteranean
    - likes soil that drains, which means more frequent watering, needs light
  - Another hand, Peace Lily
    - this needs less light than you think. No, even less light than that.

### Good Starter Plants

- Spider plant
  - thrives on "belevolent neglect"
  - Overwater? great. Under-water? lets you know, survives well
  - At beginning of quarantine I abandoned one in my office. Got it three weeks later and it lost leaves, but survived
  - Puts out cheerful "spiderlings" that can be potted separate and given to friends
    - Seriously I have so many of these you can have two
- Aloe Vera
  - Also very difficult to kill
  - Useful - you can cut off leaves and cut them open and use on sunburn, etc.
  - Some people also eat the gel? It's kinda gross and I wouldn't do it.
  - These guys will survive almost anything.
- Green onions
  - When you cut the green off these you can put the root parts in water (not covered) and they will re-grow
  - Keep the water up
  - Change out the water once per week
- Depending on the plants, water plants seem like they would be an easy start?
  - I currently have a Water Hyacinth
  - Easy to tell when it needs water because it... floats on the water...
  - But also - these are invasive exotics in the South, so, grain of salt

## Watering

- My perspective
  - Don't water on a schedule
  - This almost always ends up with over-watering
  - If you need a schedule, schedule checking-on-plants, more frequently
  - Best way until you get to know your plants:
    - Stick your finger about an inch into the soil
    - If soil is dry an inch down, water
    - Add enough water to get most of the soil wet
      - some should come through the soil and flow into the saucer
      - This is the saucer's job and it gets sad if it can't do its job
- Eventually a watering can thing can be nice but you don't really need it at first
  - just water toward the base of the plant without too much disturbing, no worries

## Light

- Be aware of how much light things are listed as needing
- Full, Partial, Shade, Direct/Indirect
  - But also, experiment and see what that means for your plant too
- General rule for herbs/veggies:
  - If we eat to roots (carrots, potatoes) can get away with 6h of sun
  - If we eat the leaves (basil, rosemary), can get away with 7h
  - If we eat the fruit (strawberries, tomatoes), gonna need 8h
- For full light plants, south facing windows are your friend, because of the way globes work
- As a general rule, the more sun a plant is getting the faster the soil will dry out
  - This is more for your shade plants - they will generally need to be watered less often
- If a plant gets "leggy" (long stems) it means it's trying to reach the light - probably needs to be closer to light

## Inside/Outside

- You can grow plants inside or outside!
- But - the transition is hard on plants
  - especially if they have been inside for a while and you move them outside, people tell you to "harden off"
    - basically, they will get sunburned/overexposed
    - thing to do is each day put them out for gradually longer, etc. etc.
    - Do I do this? No. ...Mostly I let them be shocked and lose their leaves. Which is terrible, but.
